# ImagesViewer
Code to display images in a page like Google Images does

### how to make it work?
Really simple:
* just add `_inc` folder in the root of the site.
* then, add `view.php` file in the folder where the images are stored for posterior view.


Edit `_inc` for applying styles in: header, footer and css.
